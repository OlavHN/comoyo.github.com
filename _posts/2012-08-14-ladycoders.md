title: How to make more girls code? Support LadyCoders’ Kickstarter project
category: LadyCoders

As an ambitious internet company Comoyo have grown from 25 people to ca. 80 in
1.5 year, mostly through hiring engineers, and we have painfully experienced
that finding female programmers is HARD! 

Not that they’re not good enough, there just aren’t very many around to choose
from. When recruiting for more senior tech lead roles, I’ve had headhunters
deliver me long lists of up to 70 candidates, none of which were women. And
this is in Norway, reputedly the [second most gender equal country in the
world](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/12/top-countries-for-gender-_n_760012.html#s154764&title=Norway__2).
This year, we had a female summer intern, and we recently hired our first
full-time female coder, but our ambitions are higher. 

It’s an objective for us to have a good gender balance among our employees.
First of all for the social atmosphere, but also to have development teams that
are representative of our users. In addition, we think it’s important to have
more women in the one industry that might impact our societies the most in the
years to come - the world needs the ideas of women when it comes to how
technology can be used to solve problems.

##So why are there so few women in tech?##
In our view, girls need to be made
aware of the opportunities that lie in programming at an early stage,
preferably in junior high/high school. In a recent article titled [“Why don’t
girls want to be geeks?”](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18687247) Carol
Dawkins, an IT teacher, gives the following explanation: 

<blockquote>
Boys are more, 'Game
on' - they don't mind if they make mistakes. They are more confident around the
technology, whereas girls are a little bit shy, on the back foot before they
start.
</blockquote>

A lot of the misconceptions about [programmers](http://www.uproxx.com/webculture/2012/02/meme-watch-what-people-think-i-do-versus-what-i-really-do-reminds-us-that-all-jobs-kinda-suck/attachment/whatpeoplethinkido-15-female-programmer/)
need to be adjusted, and we in the industry need to provide role models who can
show that programming is both social, challenging and requires creativitiy and
vision.  

This summer we stumbled across a cool project on Kickstarter: [LadyCoders](http://ladycoders.com/) are three women with substantial tech careers who want
to use their experiences to *“put on a training seminar to show women how to
bridge the gap between a computer science degree and programming skills, and a
solid career in software and web development.”* According to LadyCoders, *“women
lack mentorship at every single level of an information technology career.”* The
seminar will result in a DVD/downloadable movie and 20 free web videos. 

So, we decided to pledge $250 to their campaign - and we encourage others to do
the same! The campaign ends today, so hurry up.

##Get your CV reviewed - or get an interview with us!##
In return for our pledge,
we get to submit the CV of one lucky girl to the three LadyCoders, and have
them review it and give feedback to the candidate, with the aim of improving
her chance for getting job interviews. So, we want to invite all coder girls
who are interested in improving their CV to [send us an e-mail](mailto:jobs@comoyo.com)
and say something like *“I want to have an awesome CV!”* and you
might be drawn as the lucky winner! 

If you are also interested in an internship, summer job or full-time job at
Comoyo, attach your CV and our recruiter will get back to you.

##What next?##
We at Comoyo aim to work closely with the relevant communities here
in Norway to give aspiring female programmers a good impression of what it’s
like to work as a programmer here, and show what kind of opportunities lies in
the world of code. We do a lot of fun stuff we think girls should be interested
in. Stay tuned.
