As part of the ever-changing internet industry, we at Comoyo are totally dependent on having fresh ideas and new thinking for solving the problems we’re facing. And we think that there few better ways get that kind of impulses than to involve students in our daily work. We currently have 4 students working part-time besides their studies, and we’re now hiring summer interns for 2013 - you can apply [here](https://comoyo.recruiterbox.com/jobs/10751/)

This summer we had 9 summer interns, and they worked on a variety of projects:
