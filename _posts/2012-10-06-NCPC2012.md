Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest (NCPC) is considered the national championship in programming in Norway. Teams are participating from several locations; Uni. of Oslo and NTNU in Trondheim in Norway, and several universities in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. Comoyo has been lucky enough to initiate a cooperation with the student association organizing the contest at the University of Oslo, namely [MAPS](http://www.maps-uio.no/) (Mathematics, Algorithms and Programming for Students). Since several of our employees are new graduates, we decided to run a team in the professionals class to see if we could measure up against the young and aspiring students. 

##The Problems#
Problems are designed to test algorithm and problem-solving skills, much like the challenges we face every day at Comoyo. You'll find the [problem set in PDF here](http://ncpc.idi.ntnu.no/ncpc2012/ncpc2012problems.pdf).

> The goal when designing the problems is that everyone should be able to solve at least one problem, and no one should be able to solve all the problems, but all the problems should be solved by someone. 
> <cite>Matias Holte, member of NCPC problem committee</cite>
