			<p class="page-lead center">
				We want to make life on the internet easier, richer, and more fun. Our goal is to create useful services that people rely on every day. Since change is the only constant, we believe that a product is never finished &ndash; it is only a representation of users’ needs at the time. 
			</p>
			<p class="center">
				We build backend and infrastructure components that scale and can be reused across products and countries, allowing us to roll out new services quickly. Achieving scale is important to allow us to offer our users affordable services and the best content.

				<h1>Some of the values that guide our work</h1>
			</header>
			<p class="page-lead subtitle center">
				We want to build a culture based on strong values. Here are some of them.
			</p>
			<ol class="center">
				<li>We continuously improve our skills - by doing things, not talking or making powerpoints</li>
				<li>We constantly challenge ourselves and seek out situations and people who can challenge us</li>
				<li>We build and operate our core components. We combine open source and self-written software as appropriate, but keep competence and ability to change, improve, and adapt.</li>
				<li>We don't launch and forget. An unmaintained component is a dying, rotting component.</li>
				<li>No code is known by only one person. We use code reviews and pair programming to spread knowledge.</li>
				<li>We give each other direct and honest feedback about product/code quality etc. Feedback is used as an opportunity for learning and improving.</li>
				<li>According to agile principles, we don't start out with a fat spec, but make working programs in small steps. We get early feedback and adjust the direction we're going in.</li>
				<li>After each iteration, we analyze what we can learn and how we should change.</li>
