      Works hard with enabling Comoyo's services to run on all devices (with the hidden agenda of watching even more football on all occasions). 
      Very fond of ice cream, but also the [suicide chocolate cake](http://www.dishtip.com/d/la/new-orleans/brennan's-restaurant/chocolate-suicide-cake/2891283) served in New Orleans.

    about: |
      Øyvind Bakksjø is a software developer who is not smart enough to maintain
      complex code. As a survival strategy, he has developed a talent for
      identifying antipatterns and writing code that you can read and understand.
      He has great attention to detail and is a much feared code reviewer. The
      only circumstance under which he’d stop developing software is if he could
      somehow support himself while spending his time kayaking the world’s
      whitewater.

    about: |
      Jan got in a real life fight when someone declared JavaScript 'just some scripting language'. He used to channel his JavaScript 
      love as a member of the Cloud9 IDE development team, making bad jokes about VBScript and dreaming of happy hour. Now he set out to take over the mobile world with Firefox OS. 
      You can see him live on stage regularly, talking about mobile development. As for dessert, beer goes a long way.

      Vidar is a young mathematician trying to become a software developer at Comoyo. In his spare time he solves Rubik's cubes, juggle, ride his unicycle in the woods or something else useful. His favorite dessert is passion fruite cheesecake. Not any passion fruit cheesecake, but the one they got in Lisbon.

      John Edvard loves to play games and develop software (games in particular). He is also passionate about listening to and playing music. The result is that he is most comfortable in front of a computer with a guitar in his lap while eating his favorite dessert: Ice cream!
