      finding stuff, making code from coffee and long walks by the C. Comes from a cold place,
       but has a hot temper. An avid Homebrewer and beer lover, but is partial to apple cake and mango muffins.

      Works hard with enabling Comoyo's services to run on all devices (with the hidden agenda of watching even more football on all occasions). Very fond of ice cream, but also the [suicide chocolate cake](http://www.dishtip.com/d/la/new-orleans/brennan's-restaurant/chocolate-suicide-cake/2891283) served in New Orleans.

      Øyvind Bakksjø is a software developer who is not smart enough to maintain
      complex code. As a survival strategy, he has developed a talent for
      identifying antipatterns and writing code that you can read and understand.
      He has great attention to detail and is a much feared code reviewer. The
      only circumstance under which he’d stop developing software is if he could
      somehow support himself while spending his time kayaking the world’s
      whitewater.

      Jan got in a real life fight when someone declared JavaScript 'just some scripting language'. Now he set out to take over the mobile world with Firefox OS. 
      You can see him live on stage regularly, with talks mobile development. As for dessert, beer goes a long way.
